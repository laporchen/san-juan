Final Project for Programming.
Ending my freshman life with this and quarantine.

About this project

    Basically just a board game called "San Juan"
    The "HowToPlay" file is the tutorial for the game itself.

How to build the game

    make

That's it. I did not make a lot of stuff in Makefile.

Play the game

    ./SanJuanTheGame

How to control 

    All the control is by typing in the index of the option you want to perform.

Use the save file editor

    ./Editor

Or just open it in the menu of the game.
