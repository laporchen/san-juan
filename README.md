# San Juan

Final Project for Programming.
Ending my freshman life with this and quarantine.

## About this project

Basically just a board game called "San Juan"
The "HowToPlay" file is the tutorial for the game itself.



## How to build the game

> ### make

That's it. I did not make a lot of stuff in Makefile.

## Play the game

> ### ./SanJuanTheGame

## How to control 

All the control is by typing in the index of the option you want to perform.

## Use the save file editor

> ### ./Editor

Or just open it in the menu of the game.
